# Product Context: Kyperus Theme

## Why Kyperus Exists
Shopify’s default themes can be slow and lack advanced SPA-like navigation. Kyperus solves this by providing a theme with near-instant navigation, advanced caching, and performance optimizations, while remaining fully compatible with Shopify’s ecosystem.

## Problems Solved
- Slow page loads and navigation in traditional Shopify themes.
- Lack of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
- Insufficient user control over performance features.

## User Experience Goals
- Navigation feels instant and seamless.
- Loading states are visually clear and professional.
- Works reliably across all browsers and devices.
- All enhancements are optional and configurable.
- Fallbacks ensure no user is left behind.

## How It Should Work
- SPA navigation intercepts clicks and loads pages instantly.
- Caching and preloading optimize repeat visits and navigation.
- Performance features auto-disable in the Shopify Theme Editor.
- All settings are exposed in the theme’s configuration.
