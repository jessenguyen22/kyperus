# Project Brief: Kyperus Theme

## Project Overview
Kyperus is a Shopify theme based on the Dawn Theme (v15.3.0), enhanced with a Hydrogen-like performance system. The goal is to deliver near-instant navigation (1-3s → 0-50ms) and a highly optimized, progressive, and resilient user experience.

## Core Requirements
- Achieve best-in-class navigation speed and performance.
- Progressive enhancement: works without JavaScript, enhanced with it.
- Seamless compatibility with Shopify Theme Editor and settings.
- All features must be configurable by the user.
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks throughout.

## Scope
- SPA-like navigation and transitions using custom JavaScript.
- Advanced caching and preloading strategies.
- Performance optimizations at network, cache, and rendering layers.
- Modular, maintainable, and well-documented codebase.
- Support for modern and legacy browsers with graceful degradation.

## Out of Scope
- Major UI redesigns outside the Dawn base.
- Features not compatible with Shopify’s theme architecture.
